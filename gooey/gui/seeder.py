    Invoke the processes specified by `cmd`.
    Assumes that the process speaks JSON over stdout. Non-json response

    Implementation Note: I don't know why, but `Popen` is like ~5-6x faster
    than `check_output`. in practice, it means waiting for ~1/10th
    of a second rather than ~7/10ths of a second. A
    difference which is pretty weighty when there's a
    user waiting on the other end.
