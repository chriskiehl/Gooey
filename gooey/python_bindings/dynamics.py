"""
All things Dynamic Updates & Validation.

Hear me all ye who enter!
=========================

This is a module of disgusting hacks and monkey patching. Control flow
is all over the place and a comprised of hodgepodge of various strategies.
This is all because Argparse's internal parsing design (a) really,
really, REALLY wants to fail and sys.exit at the first error it
finds, and (b) does these program ending validations at seemingly random
points throughout its code base. Meaning, there is no single centralized
validation module, class, or function which could be overridden in order to
achieve the desired behavior.

All that means is that it takes a fair amount of indirect, non-standard, and
gross monkey-patching to get Argparse to collect all its errors as it parses
rather than violently explode each time it finds one.

For additional background, see the original design here:

Gooey encountered an unexpected error while trying to communicate

|Gooey Event Deserialization Error!|
+==================================+

Gooey was unable to deserialize the payload returned from your 
program when processing one of the {Events._fields} events. 

The payload *MUST* be in the `GooeyPublicState` schema. You can 
view the type information in `gooey.python_bindings.types.py`

Note, these features are new an experimental. This may be a bug on 
Gooey's side!

    the exception and silently records the failure.

    For certain argument types, Argparse calls a
    one-off `check_value` method. This method is inconvenient for us
    as it either returns nothing or throws an ArgumentException (thus leading
    to a sys.exit). Because our goal is to collect ALL
    errors for the entire parser, we must patch around this behavior.
